// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.

var firstNumber = prompt("Please enter the first number: ");
var secondNumber = prompt("Please enter the second number: ");
var sumNumbers = Number(firstNumber) + Number(secondNumber);
var multNumbers = Number(firstNumber) * Number(secondNumber);
var divNumbers = Number(firstNumber) / Number(secondNumber);
var subsNumbers = Number(firstNumber) - Number(secondNumber);
alert("The sum of the numbers is: " + sumNumbers + "\n" +
    "The multiplication of the numbers is: " + multNumbers + "\n" +
    "The division of the numbers is: " + divNumbers + "\n" +
    "The substraction of the numbers is: " + subsNumbers + "\n");

// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  


// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!
